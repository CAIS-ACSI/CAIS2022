# Bio
Tami Oliphant is an Associate Professor at the School of Library and Information Studies at the University of Alberta. Oliphant’s program of research centers upon using critical approaches to interrogate and critique conceptions of data, information, and knowledge and their attendant systems, platforms, and information institutions particularly public libraries. Oliphant is interested in the cognitive and social aspects of human information interaction and understanding people’s status as knowers (epistemology), social locations, the broader social forces that shape people’s interactions with information, critical approaches to the library and information professions, and LIS education. With Dr. Danielle Allard and Angela Lieu, she is currently engaged in a research project that draws from intersectional feminist anti-violence frameworks to examine patron-perpetrated sexual harassment in libraries.
