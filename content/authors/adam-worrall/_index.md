# Bio
My name is Adam Worrall and I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Alberta School of Library and Information Studies. I earned my PhD from the Florida State University School of Information and also hold an MS in Library and Information Studies from FSU and a BS in Computer Science from the University of Central Florida.

I study information-centric communities that are wholly or partially online. I have particular interest in the roles played by information and communication technologies (ICTs) in online information-centric communities and the relationships and interactions they have with users and their information sharing behaviours and practices within and across community boundaries. I approach this research through the lenses of information behaviour, information practice, and social informatics perspectives, the latter a primary influence on my scholarship.
