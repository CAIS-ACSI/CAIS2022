abstract: "This paper presents early findings of an ongoing investigation about information seeking and sharing patterns among birdwatched on YouTube. The research aims to find out how they seek and share hobby-related information and to what extent publicly available multimedia resources on YouTube can satisfy their information needs. The researcher analysed 1988 comments from a sample of the most visited birdwatching videos to identify the patterns based on the user-generated contents to address the questions. The findings show birdwatching is a very information-rich context, and birdwatchers are involved in various information activities to pursue their hobbies."
