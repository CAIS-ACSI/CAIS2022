abstract: "Curiosity is seen as an integral part of information-seeking, including the power to transform, innovate, and synthesize, as well as the power to disrupt. While there is consensus that curiosity is vital to learning, innovation, and transformative change, scientists have yet to agree on definitions or categories of curiosity, and little is known about how best to engage learners’ curiosity in academic libraries. This paper presents interview findings with 41 transfer students. Students reflected on their experiences with libraries and on moments when they felt intensely curious or passionate about learning. Findings indicate that students’ curiosity ignites through ideas, hands-on learning, interpersonal, and lived experiences. Implications follow for library workers to consider how curiosity is framed within their institutions and intentionally cultivate learners’ curiosity."
