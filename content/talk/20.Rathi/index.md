abstract: "Social media such as Twitter and Facebook are used by organizations including public libraries to disseminate a variety of information to community members. This research aims to identify key areas in which Twitter was used to share information with users during the initial pandemic phase by a large public library operating in the Western region of Canada. The findings resulting from the analysis of 150 tweets revealed that the library shared information primarily in the following areas: Programs and Services, Library Operations, Health and Hygiene, Resources, and Other."
