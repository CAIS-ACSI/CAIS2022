abstract: "It has been said and re-said that reference librarians only answer roughly 50% of reference questions correctly. But as this statistic is passed around as fact - where does it come from? In this lightning talk, I look at the events that made the study a staple in the library zeitgeist and re-analyze data through a modern, reference lens.
</br>
Before the report of the accuracy of reference questions at Maryland public libraries came out, library publications were already talking about it and what the results implied (Gers & Seward, 1985). While there were other studies of reference services, the findings from this one became a dominant part of library culture, even if the citation is often unknown. The study found that only 55% of reference questions were answered correctly.
</br>
However, the data was analyzed with a traditional reference mindset - where correct answers were full answers given directly at the desk. But, only 16% of the answers were tagged incorrect or no answer. And the rest were partial answers, such as providing a source to find the answer, or a referral either in the library or outside the library. While these might not have been correct answers in the traditional sense, today, in our modern reference world, these answers would be considered correct, especially as we push to teach how to find answers rather than just supply them. As such, the myth of reference staff only providing the right answer in 50% of cases is dated and should be left behind."
