abstract: "Despite increasing awareness and advantages of open access (OA) publishing, the uptake of OA in some disciplines is still low. In this study, we surveyed 228 early and mid-career researchers from 15 public universities in Canada. Findings show that altruism (r =.352) mostly influenced researchers’ OA publishing practices. Furthermore, ANOVA results showed that researchers’ career stages have significant effect on their OA publishing practices (F (2, 212) = 4, 449, p = .012, 𝜂2=.041). Therefore, building structures and policies that spur researchers’ altruism towards publishing OA should be a continuous and futuristic approach to achieving the ideals of OA."
