abstract: "In the spirit of contemplative pedagogy, this panel introduces “The Tree of Contemplative Practices”—a graphic representation that helps educators and students to understand the main principles and seven major types of contemplative practices. Using the Tree as a framework, enthusiasts can learn contemplative practices in a systematic, secular, and bespoke manner. Sequentially, the moderator and presenters will: 1) Encapsulate their commitment to contemplative pedagogy; 2) Recount an application of The Tree of Contemplative Practices in their teaching; and 3) Demonstrate several of the Tree’s major limbs (e.g., GENERATIVE) and branches (e.g., loving-kindness meditation)."
