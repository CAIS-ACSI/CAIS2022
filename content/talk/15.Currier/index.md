abstract: "For two decades, publishers and vendors have used e-book licenses to back academic libraries into the corner. These rightsholders and intermediaries lease rather than sell content, and they dictate what constitutes permitted downstream usages. Libraries have historically used interlibrary loans to fill gaps in collections, but publishers and vendors unilaterally claim that interlibrary loans of entire e-books infringe on their exclusive rights. As a result, libraries at small and mid-sized higher education institutes are confined to only providing patrons access to e-books that fall within the limits of modest collections budgets, and hence, e-book interlibrary loans are necessary to advance and protect information equity in higher education."
