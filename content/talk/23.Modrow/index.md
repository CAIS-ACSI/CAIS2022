abstract: "Our paper explores the relationship between one of the seminal works of modern library history, Edward Edwards’s Memoirs of Libraries: Including a Handbook of Library Economy (1859) and its relationship to Britain’s Public Library Movement, especially the Public Library Acts of 1850 and 1855. Focusing on the instrumentalization of library history in service of the argument for the establishment and maintenance of municipal libraries, we show how Edwards projects the roots of this movement deep into antiquity while connecting - through integration of his Handbook of Library Economy - the nascent field of library science with the history of the library profession."
