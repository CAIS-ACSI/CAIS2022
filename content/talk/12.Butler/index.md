abstract: "Since the early 2010s, more than half of peer-reviewed journal articles have been published by the so-called oligopoly (Elsevier, SAGE, Springer-Nature, Taylor & Francis, Wiley) of academic publishers. These five publishers have now embraced open access (OA) through an author-pays model, often demanding astronomic article processing charges (APCs) that makes open access publishing unaffordable for many. This paper estimates the total amounts of APCs paid to oligopoly publishers between 2015 and 2018. The study employs bibliometric methods combining data from Web of Science (WoS), Unpaywall, open datasets of APC list prices as well as historical fees retrieved via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine."
