abstract: "This research uses bibliometric methods to trace the interdisciplinary nature of archival studies and the ‘archival multiverse’ through the analysis of academic journal articles. We first analyzed the networks of archival papers included in this study and the identified communities within it. We then analyzed the most frequent words and citations for each network. This analysis provides an overview of the structure of the archival studies in recent decades, which points to a field that is slowly developing its own identity."
