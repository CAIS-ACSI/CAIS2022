abstract: "This poster will present the preliminary results of a thematic analysis of the contents of theVancouver Public Library’s (VPL) Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube feeds throughout the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (February 1st to June 30th, 2020) to better understand what types of crisis-related services and information they are providing to the public. This data will also be compared to Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube content from the same time period in 2019 to investigate whether the pandemic has changed VPL’s social media practices in any significant ways."
