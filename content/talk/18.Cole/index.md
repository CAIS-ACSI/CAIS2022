abstract: "Capturing information behaviours and attitudes occurring in natural settings is a challenge. Observational methods are often intrusive or retrospective proxies, which may change behaviour or misrepresent attitudes. Technology enables novel approaches to in-situ quantitative data collection but rarely explores qualitative reflections; informing researchers on what happened, but not necessarily why. Recent work uses multi-method approaches that combine quantitative data, tracking experiences, feelings, and behaviours over time, with qualitative data to gain deeper insights into subjective experiences. This poster has two main objectives: (1) introduce experience sampling methods (ESM) to information and library scientists, and (2) show how traditional quantitative ESM measures can be extended with qualitative measures."
