abstract: "This ongoing study builds on previous work that established a theoretical model for developing search expertise; this model then guided the design of an MLIS course on advanced search methods. To further enrich the course content, the design included a look-back at 1970s design decisions affecting search engines and a look-forward from challenges in todayâ€™s information landscape, such as algorithmic bias, filter bubbles, and market-driven results ranking. The study is evaluating the new course by analyzing peer-to-peer discourse in online discussion forums, using template analysis methodology. This paper reports on the analytical processes being used, preliminary results, and next steps."
