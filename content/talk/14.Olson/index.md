abstract: "Analyzing over 7000 academic journal articles spanning four decades, this research uses bibliometric methods to assess the hypothesis that the archival field is a feminized discipline. First, an explanation of our dataset is presented, followed by the results of the proportion of men and women amongst the authors for which we were able to assign a perceived gender. This analysis shows a gradual rise of female-perceived authorship. We then compare these results to the differences in citations between papers with female and male first authors, which shows no clear trend."
