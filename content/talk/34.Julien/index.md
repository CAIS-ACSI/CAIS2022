abstract: "This study explores the experiences of community college librarians in the United States with instructional responsibility, as they negotiate professional guidelines that challenge their existing practices. Community college environments, students, and programs differ significantly from those typically explored in information literacy research. Thus, the study gives voice to a relatively marginalized set of librarians, many of whom struggle to implement instructional approaches perceived to be more suitable for university contexts."
